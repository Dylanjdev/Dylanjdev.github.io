# Dylan J. Smith - Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website, built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It reflects my journey as a self-taught web developer and my commitment to building a future for my family through tech.

## 💡 About Me
I'm currently working full-time in electrical infrastructure — bending conduit and grounding substations. At night, I focus on learning web development and creating clean, responsive websites. With a baby on the way and big goals ahead, I'm all in on building something better.
